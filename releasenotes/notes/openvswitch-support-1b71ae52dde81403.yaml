features:
  - Implements Open vSwitch driver support using the documented
    Scenario "Classic with Open vSwitch"
    http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/networking-guide/scenario-classic-ovs.html
    Currently for Ubuntu Trusty, openvswitch-* packages are
    downloaded using the Ubuntu cloud archive repo.
upgrade:
  - Removed Variable: neutron_linuxbridge
    neutron_linuxbridge was a boolean variable used to detect whether
    or not the neutron_linuxbridge_agent service should be enabled.
    This functionality has been replaced with an inline boolean
    service_en: "{{ neutron_plugin_type == 'ml2.lxb' }}"
    in the neutron_services dictionary.
  - Removed Variable: neutron_driver_interface
    neutron_driver_interface was used in various neutron configuration
    files to specify the use of the BridgeInterfaceDriver while using
    linux bridge networking.  This value has been moved to the
    neutron_plugins dictionary for plugin type ml2.lxb
  - Removed Variable: neutron_driver_firewall
    neutron_driver_firewall specified the firewall driver in the
    configuration file linuxbridge_agent.ini.  This value has been
    moved to the neutron_plugins dictionary for plugin type ml2.lxb.
  - Removed Variable: neutron_ml2_mechanism_drivers
    neutron_ml2_mechanism_drivers was used in the configuration file
    ml2_conf.ini.  The value has been moved to the neutron_plugins
    dictionary for plugin type ml2.lxb.
